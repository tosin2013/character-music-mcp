# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated test repair agent using Dagger.io that monitors GitHub Actions for test failures, analyzes the failures, attempts to fix them automatically, and creates pull requests with the proposed fixes. The agent will integrate with GitHub's API to detect failing tests, use AI-powered analysis to understand the root cause, generate fixes, and submit them as pull requests for review.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated agent to detect when tests fail in GitHub Actions, so that I can be notified immediately without manually monitoring CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GitHub Action workflow fails THEN the system SHALL detect the failure within 5 minutes
2. WHEN a test failure is detected THEN the system SHALL extract the failure logs and error messages
3. WHEN multiple tests fail in the same workflow THEN the system SHALL process each failure independently
4. WHEN monitoring the CI workflow THEN the system SHALL track all jobs: test, documentation-validation, quality-checks, security-scan, performance-benchmark, quality-monitoring, and deploy-reports
5. WHEN a matrix job fails THEN the system SHALL identify which Python version (3.10, 3.11, 3.12) caused the failure
6. IF the failure is not test-related THEN the system SHALL skip processing and log the event

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to analyze test failures intelligently using DeepSeek API, so that it can understand the root cause and propose appropriate fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test failure is detected THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to parse the error logs and identify the failure type
2. WHEN analyzing failures THEN the system SHALL categorize them as syntax errors, import errors, assertion failures, runtime errors, coverage failures, linting errors, type checking errors, or security scan failures
3. WHEN the failure involves missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to identify the required packages and update uv requirements
4. WHEN the failure involves code changes THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to analyze the diff and understand the context
5. WHEN a coverage failure occurs THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to identify which files need additional test coverage
6. WHEN a Ruff linting error occurs THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to understand the error and apply the suggested formatting fixes
7. WHEN a mypy type checking error occurs THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to add appropriate type annotations
8. WHEN a security scan failure occurs THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to suggest security improvements
9. WHEN using DeepSeek API THEN the system SHALL include relevant code context, error messages, and repository structure in the prompt
10. IF the failure cannot be categorized THEN the system SHALL flag it for manual review

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to automatically generate fixes for common test failures using DeepSeek API, so that simple issues can be resolved without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a syntax error is detected THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to generate the corrected syntax
2. WHEN an import error is detected THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to add the missing import statements and update PYTHONPATH if needed
3. WHEN an assertion failure is detected THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to analyze expected vs actual values and propose fixes
4. WHEN a dependency issue is detected THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to update pyproject.toml and uv.lock files appropriately
5. WHEN a coverage failure occurs THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to generate additional test cases to meet the 80% threshold
6. WHEN a Ruff formatting error occurs THEN the system SHALL run `ruff format` to fix formatting issues
7. WHEN a Ruff linting error occurs THEN the system SHALL apply `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues
8. WHEN a mypy error occurs THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API to add type annotations or ignore comments as appropriate
9. WHEN using DeepSeek API for fix generation THEN the system SHALL provide the full file context, error details, and coding standards
10. WHEN generating fixes THEN the system SHALL preserve existing code style and formatting
11. IF multiple fix strategies are possible THEN the system SHALL choose the most conservative approach

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to create pull requests with the proposed fixes, so that I can review and merge the changes through the standard workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a fix is generated THEN the system SHALL create a new branch with a descriptive name
2. WHEN creating a pull request THEN the system SHALL include a detailed description of the failure and fix
3. WHEN creating a pull request THEN the system SHALL reference the original failing workflow run
4. WHEN creating a pull request THEN the system SHALL add appropriate labels (e.g., "automated-fix", "test-repair")
5. WHEN multiple fixes are needed THEN the system SHALL create separate pull requests for each logical fix
6. IF the fix involves multiple files THEN the system SHALL group related changes in a single pull request

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to validate fixes before creating pull requests, so that proposed changes don't introduce new failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a fix is generated THEN the system SHALL run the affected tests locally to verify the fix
2. WHEN running validation tests THEN the system SHALL use the same Python version and uv environment as the original failure
3. WHEN validating unit test fixes THEN the system SHALL run `pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov=. --cov-fail-under=80`
4. WHEN validating integration test fixes THEN the system SHALL run `pytest tests/integration/ -v --timeout=300`
5. WHEN validating documentation fixes THEN the system SHALL run the documentation validation scripts
6. WHEN validating quality fixes THEN the system SHALL run Ruff and mypy checks
7. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL proceed with pull request creation
8. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and try alternative fixes
9. IF no valid fix can be generated THEN the system SHALL create an issue describing the failure for manual review

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to configure which types of failures the agent should attempt to fix, so that I can control the automation level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the agent THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling fix categories (unit tests, integration tests, documentation, quality checks, security scans)
2. WHEN configuring the agent THEN the system SHALL allow setting file path patterns to include/exclude
3. WHEN configuring the agent THEN the system SHALL allow setting maximum number of concurrent fix attempts
4. WHEN configuring the agent THEN the system SHALL allow specifying which Python versions to target for fixes
5. WHEN configuring the agent THEN the system SHALL allow setting coverage thresholds and quality standards
6. WHEN a failure type is disabled THEN the system SHALL skip processing and create an informational issue instead
7. IF no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults (syntax, import, and formatting fixes only)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to integrate seamlessly with existing GitHub workflows, so that it doesn't interfere with normal development processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent creates a pull request THEN it SHALL not trigger additional CI runs until manually approved
2. WHEN the agent detects a failure THEN it SHALL check if a similar fix PR already exists
3. WHEN multiple workflows fail with the same issue THEN the system SHALL create only one fix PR
4. WHEN the original issue is resolved by other means THEN the system SHALL close any pending fix PRs
5. IF the repository has branch protection rules THEN the system SHALL respect them when creating PRs
