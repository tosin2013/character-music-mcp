# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the test coverage and organization of the character-driven music generation MCP server, with a specific focus on album creation workflows and user-facing documentation. The current testing infrastructure is fragmented across multiple files and lacks comprehensive coverage of the album creation process. Additionally, users need clear documentation with example prompts to understand how to effectively use the system for creating complete albums.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the MCP server, I want comprehensive and well-organized test coverage, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL provide coverage for all major MCP tools including analyze_character_text, generate_artist_personas, create_suno_commands, complete_workflow, and creative_music_generation
2. WHEN testing album creation workflows THEN the system SHALL validate the complete pipeline from character analysis through multiple song generation
3. WHEN tests are organized THEN the system SHALL group related tests into logical test suites with clear naming conventions
4. WHEN test data is used THEN the system SHALL utilize consistent, realistic test scenarios that represent actual use cases
5. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL verify data consistency across all workflow steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP server, I want clear documentation with example prompts for album creation, so that I can effectively use the system to generate complete musical projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guides for creating albums from narrative text
2. WHEN a user needs example prompts THEN the system SHALL offer template prompts for different album creation scenarios (character-driven, concept albums, genre-specific)
3. WHEN a user wants to understand workflow options THEN the system SHALL document all available paths from single songs to complete albums
4. WHEN a user encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guides with common problems and solutions
5. WHEN a user wants to optimize results THEN the system SHALL include best practices for prompt engineering and character development

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want automated test validation for album creation calls, so that I can ensure the system properly handles complex multi-song generation requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN album creation is requested THEN the system SHALL validate that all required character analysis components are present
2. WHEN multiple songs are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure thematic consistency across the album
3. WHEN Suno commands are created for albums THEN the system SHALL verify that song variations maintain artistic coherence
4. WHEN album metadata is generated THEN the system SHALL validate completeness of track listings, themes, and production notes
5. WHEN error conditions occur during album creation THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want performance and reliability tests for the complete workflow, so that I can ensure the system handles various input sizes and complexity levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large narrative texts are processed THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN multiple characters are detected THEN the system SHALL handle character relationship mapping without performance degradation
3. WHEN concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL maintain response quality and avoid resource conflicts
4. WHEN edge cases are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle minimal character data, empty inputs, and malformed requests gracefully
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback about processing limitations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user creating music from narrative content, I want example workflows with placeholder prompts, so that I can understand how to structure my input for optimal results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to create a character-driven album THEN the system SHALL provide template narratives with expected outcomes
2. WHEN a user needs prompt examples THEN the system SHALL offer placeholder text for different narrative styles (novel excerpts, character descriptions, thematic concepts)
3. WHEN a user wants to understand output formats THEN the system SHALL document the structure of generated Suno commands and metadata
4. WHEN a user needs workflow guidance THEN the system SHALL provide decision trees for choosing between different generation approaches
5. WHEN a user wants to iterate on results THEN the system SHALL explain how to refine inputs based on initial outputs
