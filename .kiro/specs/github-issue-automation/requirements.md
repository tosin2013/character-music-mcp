# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated GitHub issue processing system that reads open issues from a GitHub repository, creates branches and pull requests for each issue, implements real code changes to resolve the issues, and manages the entire workflow through the GitHub MCP server. Based on analysis of the current repository (decision-crafters/character-music-mcp), the primary focus is on addressing the critical test coverage improvement issue (currently at 42.13%, needs to reach 85%+) and other identified code quality issues. The system is designed to handle multiple issues efficiently while providing comprehensive tracking and error handling capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to authenticate with GitHub through MCP server, so that I can securely access repository data and perform operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL authenticate with the configured GitHub MCP server instance using mcp_github_get_me
2. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL stop execution and report a clear error message
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL have access to repository operations through MCP server including mcp_github_list_issues, mcp_github_create_branch, mcp_github_push_files, and mcp_github_create_pull_request
4. IF MCP server is not configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear configuration guidance
5. WHEN testing MCP connectivity THEN the system SHALL verify access to user repositories and permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to fetch and process open GitHub issues, so that I can automatically work on resolving them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is authenticated THEN it SHALL fetch the list of open issues from the specified repository via MCP server
2. IF fetching issues fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry before aborting
3. WHEN issues are fetched successfully THEN the system SHALL process each issue individually, prioritizing the test coverage improvement issue
4. IF no open issues exist THEN the system SHALL report completion with zero issues processed
5. WHEN processing the test coverage issue THEN the system SHALL focus on the critical areas identified: pytest-asyncio configuration, missing test fixtures, import issues, and 0% coverage files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to create dedicated branches for each issue, so that changes are isolated and properly tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing an issue THEN the system SHALL create a new branch using the naming convention `issue-{issue_number}`
2. WHEN creating a branch THEN it SHALL be created from the default branch
3. IF branch creation fails THEN the system SHALL skip the issue and continue processing others
4. WHEN a branch is created successfully THEN it SHALL be ready for code changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to implement real code changes that address each issue, so that the problems are actually resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing an issue THEN the system SHALL analyze the issue content and requirements
2. WHEN implementing changes THEN the system SHALL make real code modifications that address the described problem or feature request
3. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL ensure they fully address the issue requirements
4. IF the issue requirements are unclear THEN the system SHALL make reasonable assumptions and document them
5. WHEN addressing test coverage issues THEN the system SHALL fix pytest-asyncio configuration, add missing test fixtures, resolve import issues, and create comprehensive tests for 0% coverage files
6. WHEN implementing test fixes THEN the system SHALL ensure all tests pass and coverage increases toward the 85% target

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to validate changes before committing, so that only working code is pushed to the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL run automated tests or necessary validations
2. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL attempt to fix the issues or skip the problematic changes
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL proceed with committing the changes
4. WHEN using Python 3.11 venv THEN the system SHALL activate the virtual environment for testing
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use pytest with proper asyncio configuration
6. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL verify coverage improvements and ensure no regression in existing coverage
7. WHEN tests are added or fixed THEN the system SHALL ensure they follow the existing test patterns and use proper fixtures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to commit and push changes through MCP server, so that the repository is updated with the fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are validated THEN the system SHALL commit the updated code with descriptive commit messages
2. WHEN committing THEN the system SHALL push the changes to the remote repository via MCP server
3. IF push fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other issues
4. WHEN push succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed to create a pull request

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to create pull requests linked to issues, so that the changes can be reviewed and merged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are pushed THEN the system SHALL create a pull request from the issue's branch to the default branch
2. WHEN creating a PR THEN it SHALL be linked to the associated issue using GitHub's issue linking syntax (e.g., 'Fixes #123')
3. IF PR creation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other issues
4. WHEN PR is created successfully THEN it SHALL include a descriptive title and body

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a structured to-do list when processing many issues, so that I can track the workflow steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are more than two issues THEN the system SHALL generate a structured to-do list
2. WHEN generating the to-do list THEN it SHALL detail each step for each issue
3. WHEN the to-do list is created THEN it SHALL be included in the output format
4. IF there are two or fewer issues THEN the to-do list SHALL be optional

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging of all operations, so that I can audit and troubleshoot the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is performed THEN the system SHALL log the operation details
2. WHEN logging operations THEN it SHALL include timestamps, issue numbers, and operation results
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN the process completes THEN it SHALL provide a summary of all operations performed

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling with retry logic, so that temporary failures don't halt the entire process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP server requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic before giving up
2. WHEN GitHub API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL respect the limits and retry appropriately
3. WHEN network connectivity errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. IF an individual issue fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other issues without stopping

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to output structured results, so that I can programmatically process the outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN returning results THEN it SHALL include details for each processed issue
3. WHEN an issue is processed THEN the result SHALL include issue number, branch name, PR URL, status, and resolution summary
4. WHEN the process completes THEN it SHALL include an overall summary of the processing results

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to prioritize the test coverage improvement issue, so that code quality reaches industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing issues THEN the system SHALL identify and prioritize the test coverage improvement issue as the primary focus
2. WHEN addressing test coverage THEN the system SHALL target the critical 0% coverage files: debug_imports.py, demo_config_management.py, demo_performance_monitoring.py, enhanced_beat_generator.py, enhanced_cache_manager.py, enhanced_emotional_analyzer.py, enhanced_understand_topic_emotions.py, mcp_data_utilities.py, mcp_tool_utils.py, validate_standard_character_profile.py
