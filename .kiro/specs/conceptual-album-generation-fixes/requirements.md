# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current MCP tools for character-driven music generation have fundamental flaws that prevent them from creating meaningful conceptual albums from non-narrative content. The tools fail at character extraction from philosophical/abstract texts, produce generic content instead of maintaining character consistency, and cannot handle conceptual album creation where characters need to be constructed rather than extracted. This feature will enhance the existing codebase by integrating improved algorithms, leveraging the middleware for better tool coordination, and extending current functionality to support conceptual album generation, philosophical content processing, and consistent character development across tracks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intelligent Content Type Detection

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want the system to recognize different types of input content (narrative fiction, philosophical texts, abstract concepts, character descriptions) so that it can apply the appropriate processing strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN philosophical or abstract content is provided THEN the system SHALL identify it as non-narrative content and switch to conceptual processing mode
2. WHEN explicit character descriptions are provided THEN the system SHALL use those descriptions directly rather than attempting character extraction
3. WHEN narrative fiction is provided THEN the system SHALL use traditional character extraction methods
4. IF content type cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to specify the content type and processing approach

### Requirement 2: Conceptual Character Creation

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want to create original characters and personas from abstract concepts, philosophical ideas, or explicit descriptions so that I can build conceptual albums around these characters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provided with philosophical content THEN the system SHALL create characters that embody the philosophical concepts rather than extracting non-existent narrative characters
2. WHEN provided with explicit character descriptions THEN the system SHALL use those descriptions as the foundation for character development
3. WHEN creating conceptual characters THEN the system SHALL generate detailed backstories, motivations, and perspectives that align with the source material
4. WHEN building character personas THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all generated content for that character

### Requirement 3: Story Arc Generation for Conceptual Albums

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want the system to generate coherent story arcs and narrative progression for conceptual albums so that tracks flow together meaningfully rather than being repetitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a conceptual album THEN the system SHALL generate a story arc that progresses logically from track to track
2. WHEN generating track content THEN each track SHALL represent a distinct moment or development in the character's journey
3. WHEN creating track titles THEN the system SHALL generate meaningful, specific titles that reflect the content and progression
4. WHEN generating lyrics THEN each track SHALL have unique content that advances the narrative or explores different aspects of the character

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Emotional and Thematic Analysis

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want deep, meaningful emotional and thematic analysis of my content so that the generated music reflects the true essence and complexity of the source material.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing philosophical content THEN the system SHALL identify core themes, emotional undertones, and conceptual frameworks
2. WHEN performing emotional analysis THEN the system SHALL go beyond surface-level emotions to identify complex psychological states and philosophical tensions
3. WHEN creating thematic connections THEN the system SHALL link abstract concepts to concrete musical and lyrical elements
4. WHEN generating meta-narrative analysis THEN the system SHALL identify deeper meanings and symbolic elements in the content

### Requirement 5: Genre-Specific Production Intelligence

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want the system to understand and apply genre-specific production techniques and characteristics so that my conceptual albums sound authentic to the chosen musical style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a specific genre is requested THEN the system SHALL apply genre-appropriate production techniques, instrumentation, and stylistic elements
2. WHEN generating Suno commands THEN the system SHALL use accurate genre tags, tempo suggestions, and production notes
3. WHEN creating artist personas THEN the system SHALL align the persona's musical characteristics with the requested genre
4. WHEN building album concepts THEN the system SHALL consider how the genre can best express the conceptual content

### Requirement 6: Robust Error Handling and Fallback Strategies

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully and provide meaningful alternatives when primary processing fails so that I always get usable output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN character extraction fails THEN the system SHALL offer alternative processing modes rather than defaulting to generic templates
2. WHEN content cannot be processed as expected THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about what went wrong and suggest alternatives
3. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL validate output quality and regenerate if content is too generic or repetitive
4. WHEN tools encounter errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and attempt recovery strategies

### Requirement 7: Consistency Validation and Quality Control

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want the system to validate that generated content maintains consistency and quality across all album tracks so that the final product is coherent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating multiple tracks THEN the system SHALL validate that character voice and perspective remain consistent
2. WHEN creating album content THEN the system SHALL ensure thematic coherence while allowing for narrative progression
3. WHEN generating track titles and lyrics THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness and avoid repetitive content
4. WHEN completing album generation THEN the system SHALL perform quality checks and flag any issues for review

### Requirement 8: Flexible Input Processing

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want to provide input in various formats (narrative text, character descriptions, concept outlines, philosophical excerpts) and have the system process each appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input contains explicit character descriptions THEN the system SHALL prioritize those descriptions over extraction attempts
2. WHEN input is structured as concepts or themes THEN the system SHALL build characters and narratives around those concepts
3. WHEN input mixes different content types THEN the system SHALL intelligently separate and process each type appropriately
4. WHEN input is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions rather than making incorrect assumptions

### Requirement 9: Middleware Integration and Tool Coordination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing middleware to coordinate between MCP tools effectively so that data flows smoothly and tools can share context and state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools need to share character data THEN the middleware SHALL maintain consistent character state across all tool calls
2. WHEN processing workflows THEN the middleware SHALL coordinate tool execution and handle data transformation between tools
3. WHEN errors occur in one tool THEN the middleware SHALL provide fallback strategies and maintain workflow continuity
4. WHEN extending existing functionality THEN the middleware SHALL integrate new capabilities with existing tools seamlessly
