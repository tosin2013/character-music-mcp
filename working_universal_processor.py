Title: {title}

[Intro]
(Analog pads, warehouse ambience)
3am Bristol sessions, questioning what's real
Dad's voice echoes: "Son, you think too much to feel"

[Verse 1]
Thirty-four years of asking why
While you believed and I had to try
To demonstrate what you took on faith
Now you're gone, and I'm in this space

[Verse 2]
Warehouse walls reflect my doubt
What's this consciousness about?
Every bassline builds a case
For questions you could never face

[Chorus]
God and Soul through reason's lens
Where philosophical argument transcends
Not through doctrine, but through art
Liquid rhythms heal the heart

[Bridge]
(Spoken over minimal bass)
"The two questions respecting God and the Soul..."
Dad, you found answers in Sunday sermons
I'm finding them in 174 BPM sermons
Both of us searching for the sacred
Just different congregations

[Outro]
(Analog filter sweeps, fading)
Your faith, my doubt - same destination
Truth through different demonstration
