1. **Analyzes narrative text** using advanced three-layer character bible methodology
2. **Extracts character profiles** with psychological depth and narrative importance ranking
3. **Generates musical artist personas** through sophisticated trait-to-genre mapping
4. **Creates optimized Suno AI commands** with multiple variations and approaches
5. **Supports creative workflows** for both character-driven and abstract concept music generation

## Character Analysis Methodology

### Three-Layer Analysis Framework

#### Skin Layer - Observable Characteristics
The surface-level traits that can be directly observed:
- Physical appearance and distinctive features
- Mannerisms, gestures, and behavioral tics
- Speech patterns, vocabulary, and communication style
- Observable actions and reactions to situations

#### Flesh Layer - Background and Relationships  
The contextual information that shapes the character:
- Personal backstory and historical events
- Family relationships and social connections
- Formative experiences and life-changing moments
- Professional and romantic relationships

#### Core Layer - Deep Psychology
The fundamental psychological drivers:
- Primary motivations and life goals
- Deepest fears and insecurities
- Core desires and aspirations
- Internal and external conflicts
- Personality drivers and decision-making patterns

```
"A rock song about overcoming challenges with powerful vocals, inspired by Emma's journey through adversity and her determination to protect her family."
```

#### Custom Mode Commands
Detailed parameter specifications for precise control:
```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a folk composition exploring love and loss...",
  "style_tags": ["folk", "acoustic", "storytelling", "emotional"],
  "structure_tags": ["verse-chorus-verse", "bridge", "outro"],
  "vocal_tags": ["warm vocals", "expressive delivery"]
}
```

#### Bracket Notation Commands
Precise element control using Suno's bracket syntax:
```
"[folk] [emotional] [warm vocals] [acoustic guitar] [storytelling energy] Song inspired by Emma's journey through love and loss"
```
