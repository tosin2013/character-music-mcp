async with performance_monitor.measure_operation("download_page"):
    result = await download_page(url)
```

#### Sync Context Manager
```python
with performance_monitor.measure_sync_operation("parse_html"):
    genres = parse_html_content(html)
```

#### Function Decorator
```python
@monitor_performance("genre_mapping", performance_monitor)
async def map_traits_to_genres(traits):
    # Function implementation
    pass
