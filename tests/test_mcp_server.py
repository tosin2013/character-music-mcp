Elena Rodriguez stood in her cramped studio apartment, paintbrush trembling in her hand as she 
stared at the blank canvas. At twenty-eight, she had already given up three different career 
paths, each time running when success seemed within reach. Her mother called it self-sabotage; 
Elena called it self-preservation.

The phone rang, startling her from her thoughts. It was David, her best friend since art school 
and the only person who truly understood her creative struggles. "Still avoiding the gallery 
opening?" he asked, his voice gentle but knowing.

Elena sighed, setting down her brush. David had always been the confident one, the artist who 
embraced fame while she shrank from it. His paintings hung in galleries across the city while 
hers gathered dust in storage. Yet he never made her feel small, never pushed too hard. That's 
what made their friendship work - he knew when to offer support and when to give space.

"I'm scared, David," she admitted, the words feeling foreign on her lips. Fear had been her 
constant companion, the voice that whispered about failure and humiliation every time she 
tried to share her work with the world.
