    Sarah Chen stood at the edge of the rooftop, tears streaming down her face. 
    At twenty-seven, she had spent her entire life meeting everyone else's expectations. 
    Perfect grades, perfect job, perfect smile - but inside, she felt completely empty.
    
    "I can't do this anymore," Sarah whispered to herself, her voice barely audible 
    over the city noise below. The wind whipped her long black hair across her face 
    as she gripped the railing tighter.
    
    Behind her, the door to the roof opened. "Sarah?" called Marcus, her best friend 
    since college. "What are you doing up here?"
    
    Sarah turned to face Marcus, her eyes red from crying. "I'm thinking about jumping," 
    she said quietly. Marcus rushed forward, his heart pounding.
    
    "Don't say that," Marcus pleaded, reaching out his hand. "Talk to me. What's wrong?"
    
    Sarah looked at her friend, seeing the genuine concern in his eyes. "I feel like 
    I'm drowning, Marcus. Every day is the same. Work, sleep, repeat. I'm successful 
    on paper, but I feel completely empty inside."
    
    Marcus stepped closer, his voice gentle. "Sarah, you don't have to carry this alone. 
    I've been worried about you for months. You've been different, distant."
    
    "I didn't want to burden anyone," Sarah replied, her voice breaking. "Everyone 
    thinks I have it all figured out. The perfect job, the perfect apartment, the 
    perfect life. But it's all a lie."
