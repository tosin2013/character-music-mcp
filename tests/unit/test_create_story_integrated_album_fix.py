    Sarah Chen stood at the edge of the rooftop, tears streaming down her face. 
    At twenty-seven, she had spent her entire life meeting everyone else's expectations. 
    Perfect grades, perfect job, perfect smile - but inside, she felt completely empty.
    
    "I can't do this anymore," Sarah whispered to herself, her voice barely audible 
    over the city noise below. The wind whipped her long black hair across her face 
    as she gripped the railing tighter.
    
    Behind her, the door to the roof opened. "Sarah?" called Marcus, her best friend 
    since college. "What are you doing up here?"
    
    Sarah turned to face Marcus, her eyes red from crying. "I'm thinking about jumping," 
    she said quietly. Marcus rushed forward, his heart pounding.
    
    "Don't say that," Marcus pleaded, reaching out his hand. "Talk to me. What's wrong?"
    
    Sarah looked at her friend, seeing the genuine concern in his eyes. "I feel like 
    I'm drowning, Marcus. Every day is the same. Work, sleep, repeat. I'm successful 
    on paper, but I feel completely empty inside."
    
    Marcus stepped closer, his voice gentle. "Sarah, you don't have to carry this alone. 
    I've been worried about you for months. You've been different, distant."
    
    "I didn't want to burden anyone," Sarah replied, her voice breaking. "Everyone 
    thinks I have it all figured out. The perfect job, the perfect apartment, the 
    perfect life. But it's all a lie."
    
    Marcus reached out and gently took her hand. "It's not a lie, Sarah. You're human. 
    You're allowed to struggle. You're allowed to feel lost. But you don't have to 
    face it alone."
    
    Sarah felt tears streaming down her face as she looked at her friend. For the first 
    time in months, she felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe there was a way forward. Maybe 
    she didn't have to carry this burden alone.
    
    "Will you help me?" she asked quietly.
    
    "Always," Marcus replied without hesitation. "We'll figure this out together."

    in her hand as she stared at the blank canvas. At twenty-eight, she had already 
    spent three years working as a graphic designer for a corporate firm, but her

    building, spending eight hours creating marketing materials for products she 
    didn't care about.
    
    Her best friend Jake Thompson had been encouraging her to quit and pursue art 
    full-time. "You're incredibly talented, Elena," he'd said over coffee last week. 
    "I've seen your paintings. They're extraordinary."
