    Marcus "Solvent" Thompson is a 34-year-old liquid drum and bass producer who has spent over a decade perfecting his craft in electronic music production. His stage name "Solvent" reflects his belief that music can dissolve the barriers between rational thought and spiritual experience.

    Marcus holds a deep conviction that "the two questions respecting God and the Soul were the chief of those that ought to be demonstrated by philosophical rather than theological argument." This philosophical stance permeates every aspect of his music creation. He believes that spiritual and existential questions should be explored through reason, logic, and artistic expression rather than through dogmatic belief systems.

    At 34, Marcus has reached a philosophical crossroads in his artistic journey. He operates from a converted warehouse studio in Bristol, surrounded by vintage analog synthesizers and cutting-edge digital workstations. His approach to music production mirrors his philosophical methodology - each track begins with a thesis, basslines serve as logical arguments, and breakbeats provide rhythmic structure for philosophical discourse.

    Marcus started his musical journey with jungle music in his early twenties, evolved through technical drum and bass, and found his calling in the fluid, contemplative space of liquid drum and bass. His personality is marked by deep contemplation, introspection, valuing reason over tradition, seeking transcendence through art, and finding sacred patterns in electronic music production.

    His upcoming album explores the intersection of consciousness, divinity, and mathematical patterns found in both drum programming and metaphysical thought. Each piece of music represents an argument for understanding reality through carefully crafted sound.
