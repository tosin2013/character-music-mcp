    Marcus "Solvent" Thompson is a 34-year-old liquid drum and bass producer. He believes that "the two questions respecting God and the Soul were the chief of those that ought to be demonstrated by philosophical rather than theological argument." 
    
    This philosophical stance shapes his approach to music production. He sees each track as an argument, each bassline as a thesis, and each breakbeat as logical progression toward understanding. His upcoming album explores consciousness, divinity, and mathematical patterns in drum programming.
    
    At 34, Marcus has mastered liquid drum and bass production, allowing him to focus on deeper existential questions through his music. He started with jungle, evolved through technical DNB, and found his calling in contemplative liquid styles that balance precision with emotional depth.
    
    Marcus is contemplative, introspective, values reason over tradition, seeks transcendence through art, and finds sacred patterns in electronic music production. His studio practices involve philosophical preparation before each session.
