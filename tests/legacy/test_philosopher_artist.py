    Core philosophy: 'I have always considered that the two questions respecting God and the Soul 
    were the chief of those that ought to be demonstrated by philosophical rather than theological argument.' 
    
    This artist believes spiritual questions should be explored through reason and artistic expression 
    rather than dogma. He sees music production as philosophical inquiry, where each track is an argument, 
    each bassline a thesis, and each breakbeat a logical progression toward understanding. 
    
    At 34, his technical mastery allows him to focus on deeper questions. His upcoming album explores 
    consciousness, divinity, and mathematical patterns in both drum programming and metaphysical thought. 
    
    Started with jungle, evolved through technical DNB, found calling in contemplative liquid. Productions 
    feature intricate basslines that mirror philosophical arguments. 
    
    Personality: contemplative, introspective, values reason over tradition, seeks transcendence through art, 
    balances precision with emotion, questions authority while respecting wisdom, finds sacred in secular through music."""
