# GitHub Issues to Create Manually

## Issue 1: Critical Test Infrastructure Cleanup

**Title:** `Critical: Fix Test Collection and Syntax Issues`
**Labels:** `bug`, `testing`, `infrastructure`, `high-priority`

```markdown
## Test Infrastructure Issues

### Priority: High
**Labels:** `bug`, `testing`, `infrastructure`

### Problem Summary
Multiple test files have collection warnings due to test classes with `__init__` constructors, preventing proper test discovery and execution.

### Files Affected
- `tests/fixtures/test_data.py` (TestScenario class)
- `tests/test_config.py` (TestConfig class) 
- `tests/test_runner.py` (multiple classes: TestResult, TestSuiteResult, TestRunSummary, TestRunner)

### Current Status
- **Collection Warnings:** 6 warnings preventing proper test execution
- **Impact:** Affects test reliability and CI/CD pipeline functionality
- **Pytest Error:** `cannot collect test class 'TestX' because it has a __init__ constructor`

### Root Cause
Pytest cannot automatically collect test classes that have custom `__init__` constructors. This is a design limitation to prevent issues with test instantiation.

### Recommended Solution
1. **Option A (Preferred):** Rename classes to avoid `Test*` naming pattern:
   - `TestScenario` → `ScenarioData`
   - `TestConfig` → `ConfigData`
   - `TestResult` → `ResultData`
   - etc.

2. **Option B:** Convert to proper pytest fixtures:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def scenario_data():
       return ScenarioData(...)
   ```

3. **Option C:** Use dataclasses without custom constructors where possible

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All test collection warnings resolved
- [ ] Test discovery works correctly in CI/CD
- [ ] No functional regression in test behavior
- [ ] Documentation updated for test data patterns

### Implementation Notes
- Based on methodological pragmatism framework
- **Confidence Level:** 92% - Well-documented pytest limitation with clear solutions
- Consider establishing coding standards for test data classes

### Related
- Part of comprehensive testing infrastructure improvement
- Blocks full CI/CD pipeline reliability
- Required for accurate test coverage reporting

## Issue 2: MCP Configuration Standardization

**Title:** `Standardize MCP Server Configuration Format`
**Labels:** `configuration`, `mcp-server`, `enhancement`

```markdown
## MCP Configuration Issues

### Priority: Medium
**Labels:** `configuration`, `mcp-server`

### Problem Summary
Smoke test revealed configuration format inconsistencies. Current MCP server configs use custom format instead of standard MCP schema.

### Current Issues
- Smoke test expects `mcpServers` field but configs use different structure
- Configuration validation fails in automated testing
- Inconsistent format between `mcp-server.json` and `mcp-server-enhanced.json`

### Files Affected
- `mcp-server.json`
- `mcp-server-enhanced.json`
- `smoke_test.py` (configuration validation)

### Root Cause
The current configuration files use a custom format that doesn't align with standard MCP protocol specifications.

### Recommended Solution
1. **Research MCP standard configuration format**
2. **Update configuration files to match MCP schema**
3. **Update smoke test validation logic**
4. **Create configuration validation utilities**

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Configuration files follow MCP specification
- [ ] Smoke test configuration validation passes
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated with configuration guide

### Implementation Notes
- **Confidence Level:** 78% - Requires research into MCP standards
- May need to maintain backward compatibility
- Consider configuration migration strategy

### Impact
- Improves compatibility with MCP tooling
- Enables automated configuration validation
- Required for smoke test success

## Issue 3: Mock Context System Enhancement

**Title:** `Improve Test Mock Context System`
**Labels:** `testing`, `mock-data`, `enhancement`

```markdown
## Mock Context System Issues

### Priority: Medium
**Labels:** `testing`, `mock-data`

### Problem Summary
Current mock context system doesn't support all context types needed for testing. Multiple test failures due to "Unknown context type" errors.

### Current Failures
- Character analysis tests failing with "Unknown context type: smoke_test"
- Persona generation tests cannot create proper mock contexts
- Error handling tests blocked by context validation

### Files Affected
- `tests/fixtures/mock_contexts.py`
- `smoke_test.py`
- Multiple test files using mock contexts

### Root Cause
The mock context factory has limited support for context types and validation is too restrictive for testing scenarios.

### Recommended Solution
1. **Extend mock context factory** to support all required context types
2. **Add validation and error handling** for context type mismatches
3. **Create context type registry** for test development
4. **Document supported context types** and usage patterns

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Analyze all context types used across test suite
- [ ] Extend `create_mock_context` function with new types
- [ ] Add flexible validation that allows test scenarios
- [ ] Update documentation with context type guide
- [ ] Add context type validation utilities

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All smoke test context-related failures resolved
- [ ] Test suite can create contexts for any test scenario
- [ ] Clear documentation for test context usage
- [ ] Maintain type safety while allowing test flexibility

### Implementation Notes
- **Confidence Level:** 85% - Clear technical solution path
- Focus on test utility rather than production validation
- Consider separate test-only context types

### Impact
- Enables comprehensive smoke testing
- Improves developer experience for writing tests
- Required for automated testing reliability

## Issue 4: Complete MCP Tools Integration

**Title:** `Complete MCP Tools Integration Implementation`
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `mcp-tools`, `integration`

```markdown
## MCP Tools Integration

### Priority: Low
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `mcp-tools`

### Problem Summary
Missing MCP components identified by smoke test. These appear to be optional components that don't break core functionality.

### Missing Components
- `get_character_analysis`
- `generate_music_persona`
- `create_suno_command`

### Current Status
- Core functionality works without these components
- Smoke test logs warnings but doesn't fail
- Integration tests may be incomplete

### Files Affected
- `mcp_tools_integration.py`
- Related integration test files

### Analysis
These components appear to be optional MCP tool integrations that enhance functionality but aren't required for core operation.

### Recommended Approach
1. **Assess if these components are actually needed**
2. **Document intended functionality for each component**
3. **Implement missing components if required**
4. **Update smoke test expectations if components are optional**

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear documentation of which MCP components are required vs optional
- [ ] Either implement missing components or update test expectations
- [ ] Smoke test accurately reflects system requirements
- [ ] Integration test coverage for implemented components

### Implementation Notes
- **Confidence Level:** 65% - Unclear if components are required
- Marked as low priority as core functionality is unaffected
- May be placeholder functions for future development

### Impact
- Improves completeness of MCP integration
- Clears smoke test warnings
- May enable additional functionality
