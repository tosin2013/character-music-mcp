- Added missing `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators
- Fixed async fixture decorators
- Resolved import issues and missing dependencies
- Fixed syntax errors and malformed imports

### 4. Automation Tools
- **Created `test_coverage_improvement_plan.py`** - Automated coverage analysis and improvement
- **Created `fix_test_imports.py`** - Automated test file fixing
- **Implemented priority-based improvement strategy** for maximum impact

### 5. Documentation and Process
- **GitHub Issue Template** for test coverage improvements
- **Pull Request Template** for quality improvements
- **Comprehensive improvement plan** with phases and success criteria
- **Automated coverage tracking** and reporting

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

### Before Improvements
- **Total Coverage**: 42.13%
- **Lines Covered**: 8,305 / 15,113
- **Failed Tests**: 238 failed, 502 passed, 8 skipped
- **Major Issues**: Async test failures, import errors, missing test files

### After Infrastructure Fixes
- **Test Infrastructure**: âœ… Fixed
- **Async Test Support**: âœ… Configured
- **Import Issues**: âœ… Resolved
- **New Test Files**: âœ… 10 created and validated
- **Test Execution**: âœ… Basic tests passing

### Example Validation
```bash
$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_enhanced_beat_generator.py -v
========== 8 passed, 2 warnings in 0.02s ==========

$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_enhanced_beat_generator.py --cov=enhanced_beat_generator
Coverage: 17.30% (improved from 0%)
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Phase 2: Implement Specific Test Cases
1. **Enhanced Beat Generator** (0% â†’ 85%+)
   - Test beat pattern generation
   - Test genre-specific characteristics
   - Test emotional rhythm mapping

2. **Server Module** (27.34% â†’ 85%+)
   - Test all MCP tool endpoints
   - Test error handling scenarios
   - Test async workflow execution

3. **MCP Tools Integration** (38.96% â†’ 85%+)
   - Test character analysis workflows
   - Test persona generation
   - Test command creation

### Phase 3: Integration and Performance Tests
1. **End-to-End Workflows**
   - Complete album generation tests
   - Multi-character processing tests
   - Error recovery and fallback tests

2. **Performance and Edge Cases**
   - Load testing for critical paths
   - Memory usage validation
   - Concurrent execution tests

## ðŸ›  Tools and Scripts Created

### `test_coverage_improvement_plan.py`
Automated script that:
- Analyzes current coverage
- Identifies priority improvement areas
- Creates missing test files
- Fixes common test issues
- Validates improvements

### `fix_test_imports.py`
Utility script that:
- Fixes import issues in test files
- Corrects async fixture decorators
- Resolves common syntax errors

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Impact

### Coverage Targets
- **Overall Coverage**: 42.13% â†’ 85%+
- **Critical Modules**: 0-30% â†’ 80%+
- **Failed Tests**: 238 â†’ 0
- **Test Reliability**: Significantly improved

### Quality Benefits
- **Code Reliability**: Higher confidence in deployments
- **Bug Detection**: Earlier identification of issues
- **Refactoring Safety**: Safe code changes with test coverage
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples
