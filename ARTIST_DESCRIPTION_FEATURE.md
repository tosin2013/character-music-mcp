# Artist Description Feature

## Overview
The enhanced Music Bible now includes a compelling **Artist Description** - a single, narrative sentence that captures the artist's origin, identity, and style in a storytelling format.

## Feature Details

### Purpose
Provides a concise, compelling introduction to the artist that contextualizes their entire musical identity and production approach.

### Format
One sophisticated sentence that weaves together:
- **Artist Name**: The musical identity
- **Origin Setting**: Where they emerge from (urban landscape, creative spaces, family dynamics)
- **Musical Style**: How they create (vulnerable storyteller, ethereal presence, etc.)
- **Core Struggle**: What drives their music (tension between X and Y)
- **Transformation**: Their artistic mission (raw truth over perfection)
- **Genre Context**: Musical category and approach
- **Emotional Impact**: How they affect listeners

### Example Outputs

#### Sarah Chen → Fragile Freedom
```
"Fragile Freedom emerges from the urban landscape as a vulnerable storyteller who crafts intimate confessions, channeling the tension between perfection and authenticity into raw truth over polished perfection through indie soundscapes that confront listeners with uncomfortable truths."
```

#### Marcus Rivera → Echo Bloodlines  
```
"Echo Bloodlines emerges from complex family dynamics as an authentic artist refusing to conform, channeling the tension between loyalty and self-preservation into honest emotional exploration through folk soundscapes that confront listeners with uncomfortable truths."
```

#### Elena Rodriguez → Hidden Canvas
```
"Hidden Canvas emerges from intimate creative spaces as an ethereal presence weaving atmospheric narratives, channeling the tension between success and self-sabotage into honest emotional exploration through electronic soundscapes that confront listeners with uncomfortable truths."
```
