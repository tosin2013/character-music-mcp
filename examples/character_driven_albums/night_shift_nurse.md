## Input Narrative

```
Marcus had been working the night shift at St. Mary's Hospital for eight years, 
long enough to know that 3 AM was when people told the truth. In the fluorescent-lit 
corridors, between the beeping machines and whispered conversations, he had become 
a keeper of secrets—last words, first confessions, and everything in between.

He hadn't planned to be a nurse. The pre-med track had been his father's dream, 
but Marcus discovered he was better at healing hearts than fixing them. His large 
hands, which had once fumbled with surgical instruments, were gentle when holding 
the hand of a scared patient. His deep voice, which had struggled through organic 
chemistry presentations, could calm a panicking family member with just a few words.

The night shift suited him. During the day, the hospital buzzed with administrators 
and visiting hours, but at night, it became something different—a place where 
vulnerability was honest and help was immediate. Marcus thrived in the quiet 
intensity, the way crisis could bring out both the worst and best in people.

But eight years of absorbing other people's pain had left marks. He carried home 
stories he couldn't share, faces he couldn't forget, and a bone-deep exhaustion 
that sleep couldn't cure. His apartment felt too quiet after the constant hum 
of the hospital, and he found himself staying later each shift, reluctant to 
return to a world that felt less real than the one where he spent his nights.

The morning he found Mrs. Patterson, the elderly woman from room 314, had passed 
peacefully in her sleep, Marcus realized he had been holding his breath for years. 
She had been his favorite patient—sharp-witted and kind, with stories that made 
the long hours pass quickly. Her death wasn't tragic; she had been ready, surrounded 
by family. But it reminded Marcus that he had been so busy caring for others that 
he had forgotten to care for himself.

Standing in the hospital parking lot as the sun rose, Marcus made a decision. 
He would keep working nights—it was where he belonged—but he would also start 
living during the day. The healing he offered others needed to include himself, 
or eventually, there would be nothing left to give.
