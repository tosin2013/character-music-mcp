## Input Narrative

```
Elena grew up in the shadow of the lighthouse, where her father kept watch over ships 
that rarely came anymore. The automated systems had made his job obsolete years ago, 
but he stayed out of stubbornness and love for the solitude. Elena understood both 
impulsesâ€”she had inherited his need for quiet spaces and his fear of being needed 
by no one.

At seventeen, she spent her days reading poetry on the rocky shore, writing in 
journals that she hid beneath her mattress. The words came easily when she was 
alone, but around others, she felt like she was speaking a foreign language. Her 
classmates talked about college and careers, while Elena dreamed of staying by 
the sea forever, tending to something beautiful and forgotten.

The night her father had his heart attack, Elena realized that solitude and 
isolation weren't the same thing. She had been so busy protecting herself from 
the world that she had forgotten to let anyone in. As she sat in the hospital 
waiting room, surrounded by the fluorescent buzz of modern life, she understood 
that the lighthouse had been both sanctuary and prison.

When her father recovered, Elena made a decision. She would leave for college, 
not to escape the lighthouse, but to learn how to carry its light with her. 
The sea would always be there, but she was ready to discover what lay beyond 
the horizon she had watched for so long.
