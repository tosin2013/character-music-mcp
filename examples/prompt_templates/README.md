## Quality Guidelines

### Effective Placeholder Content

#### Character Psychology
- **Specific Emotions**: "melancholic" rather than "sad"
- **Concrete Behaviors**: "tapped fingers when nervous" rather than "was anxious"
- **Unique Details**: Personal quirks and individual characteristics
- **Internal Conflicts**: Competing desires or values

#### Background Information
- **Specific Settings**: "small coastal town" rather than "hometown"
- **Relationship Details**: How characters affect each other

### Common Template Mistakes

#### Optimization Strategies
